# vim-like-commands package

This package was designed to provide vim commands for use in atom so that you can move without leaving the home keys. Due to the fact that atom is not a modal text editor, the commands require using alt before the command of choice. For example, j in command mode for vim would be alt-j in atom.

| Command | Action     |
|--------:|:----------:|
| alt-j   | Move down  |
| alt-k   | Move up    |
| alt-l   | Move right |
| alt-h   | Move left  |
